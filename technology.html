            <h1>Amazon's Technology</h1>
            <p>
                Amazon uses a wide variety of technologies to provide its services, however the core technology is linux based. Amazon owns multiple large Linux databases with capacities greater than 15TB.
                The central data warehouse Amazon owns contains 28 Hewlett Packard servers, each node containing four CPU’s and running Oracle database software.
                Amazon’s advanced technology is able to handle millions of back-end operations on a daily basis.

            <h2 class="anchor" id="ai">Amazon Echo (AI)</h2>
            <p>
                Amazon has ventured into the world of AI through creations such as Amazon echo. Such AI’s are vigorously running through a Turing tests in order to ensure stability and level of intellect. The Turing Test is a test conducted on machines to see if the machines can behave and respond intelligently like a human.
                The test is held as an important obstacle for machines to pass, and once the machine passes the machine is on the route towards true intelligence. Artificial intelligence is aimed towards being human with the same thought process and responses. This is to show that even behind a computer screen and keyboard, the judge (you) are able to have a conversation and articulate and ask questions to the A.I. just like you would to any human being. Once these questions are asked, the A.I. would respond just like how any human would in a regular conversation, thus passing the Turing Test, but if the responses are obscured compare to a typical answer than it would not pass. The key problem is that computers don’t have the intelligence of humans, but have specialized intelligence for specific tasks. It also raises ethical issues such as building a robot that is more intelligent than humans or be given jobs that humans can do. Thus, to allow computers with A.I. they must pass the Turing Test without the human on the other side of the keyboard to know that they are in fact a robot. There are many chat bots around the internet such as Echo/Alexa and one of it is Cleverbot.
                The experience with Cleverbot is that the bot stores information on a particular subject its repeated in repetition. Attach to this report will be the experiments conducted with the various chatterbots which are: Cleverbot, ALICE, and Chomsky. When the Turing Test was conducted there are guidelines that must be met before performing the test. Even though we are behind a keyboard and a screen, we have to ask questions and wait for responses before asking another question. In short, we ask then wait for the answer instead of asking then asking another question right after. Some of the bots that were used in the experiment were indeed humanlike such as ALICE and Chomsky. As the transcripts shows for these bots, the responses are humanlike even if the bots tell you themselves they are bots, but stating it as a casual answer any person will reply with. Asking and waiting is a key factor in the test as we have to have a conversation just like human would, but with a keyboard. When the questions are answered and the human conducting the test cannot tell if it is human or a computer than the Turing Test is passed.

            <h2 class="anchor" id="ipv6">IPv6</h2>
            <p>
                As in the realm of today, PCs are beginning to incorporate all parts of our lives, from our fridges to our indoor regulators however what associates these gadgets to one another and permits them to function as they do is the web. Each gadget on the web should be recognized by one means or another, so they are doled out an Internet Protocol address, interesting to each association (generally) and it recognizes associations from one another. So the new standard was created and it was called IPv6 in light of the fact that now it has more than 4 sections, now including numbers as well as hexadecimal characters, which means letters can now be utilized. IPv6 likewise takes out a great deal of the disarray in the parcel headers, for example, the IHL, Time to Live, Options, Padding, Total Length, Header Checksum and numerous others which were available in IPv4. IPv6 has as of now been embraced by a large portion of the vast organizations, for example, Google, Microsoft and Facebook, and now Amazon while numerous others are beginning to receive this new convention. IPv4 doesn't have enough IP locations and IPv6 has enough delivers to give everybody on the planet their very own billion IPs. IPv6 ip addresses are harder on the grounds that they aren't the standard 4-12 numbers in length as IPv4 seems to be, they are commonly more and more mind boggling. There are numerous different progressions in the new IPv6 convention, for example, the changes in directing of the IPv6 data. The extent of directing tables has been decreased and made more proficient utilizing a various leveled model.
                Utilizing MTU, the discontinuity of packets is taken care of at the source of the data, no more the switch where it avoids data errors and wasteful transmissions.

            <h2 class="anchor" id="rp">Robotic prosthetics</h2>
            <p>
                Amazon has worked with companies in the past in order to aid with robotic prosthetics for veterans. Amazon has worked with such companies as Ekso Bionics. Ekso Bionics is an organization formed to help and aid certain people that are impaired in the military to recapture their versatility. The organization was begun in 2005 by Homayoon Kazerooni, Russ Angold, and Nathan Harding. Its real crucial thought is the advancement of growing human capacities. By doing this, not just are handicapped veterans that have gone into war ready to recapture versatility, yet there is additionally a plausibility of discharge to the general public. By disclosing this reason to others, Ekso has gained a partnership with UC Berkeley in development, as well as research grants bestowed by the Department of Defense.A percentage of the veterans which arrive from wars turn out to be fundamentally impaired because of the dynamic line of obligation, which is something that these veterans must be reimbursed for. Carrying on an existence with challenged mobility is a horrendous circumstance to be in. In this way, the best sort of reimbursement is to reissue the mobility of these veterans, and, ideally, the injured in America's general public.
