            Amazon.com is an e-commerce company based in Seattle, Washington, and was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos.
            Currently, it is the largest online store of the United States.
            Amazon.com was initially created as an online bookstore, eventually broadening its range of products to
            digital media,
            such as CDs, DVDs and audiobooks, as well as other products, for example electronics, furniture, toys and
            food.
            Amazon.com also produces some of its own electronics, including its well-known Kindle e-reader and range of
            “Fire” products, such as the Fire TV and Fire Phone.
            Amazon also owns several well-known brands, such as IMDB, audible.com and Twitch.tv.
            Amazon.com has an international customer base, with establishments in several countries around the world.

      <h1 id="history" class="anchor">A brief history of Amazon.com</h1>
      <p>
        Amazon.com, Inc was founded as Cadabra on 5 July 1994, Seattle, Washington, by Jeff Bezos.
        Jeff Bezos was initially working at D. E. Shaw & Co, a Wall Street company, as vice president, but he left and
        moved to Seattle, where he worked on a business plan.
        Bezos changed the name of the company to Amazon after Cadabra was misheard as “cadaver” the next year and the
        Amazon.com website was also launched in 1995.<sup><a href="#01">[1]</a></sup><br>
        When Bezos read a report on the future of the Web which suggested an annual growth of 2300%, he made a list of
        some 20 products that would work well for e-commercing.
        He felt that the five most promising of those were computer hardware, computer software, CDs, videos and books.
        He finally settled for books online, because of the large international demand, the relatively low price and the
        sheer amount of titles.
        Within a month of its launch, Amazon had already shipped books to all US states and 45 countries worldwide, and
        within four months of its launch, the website became the largest book-selling site of the Web.
        On its launch, Amazon.com already had a database containing more than a million book titles, as well as a search
        engine that allowed customers to enter the title of a book,
        have the system search the site’s database and then display information about that book, while offering the
        option of payment via credit card and promising delivery within a couple of days.
        On 15 May 1997, Amazon went public with an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of three million shares of common
        stock.
        That year, Amazon also opened another distribution center in New Castle, Delaware, which made Amazon more
        popular with East Coast customers, as well as publishers.<sup><a href="#01">[1]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#02"
                                                                                                          id="2">[2]</a></sup>
        <sup><a href="#03" id="3">[3]</a></sup><br>
        In 1998, Amazon chose to move beyond books, as the decision to enter the online music business was made, while
        also acquiring the Internet Movie Database (IMDB).
        Since 2000, the Amazon logo features an arrow pointing from the letter A to Z, to represent their diversity of
        products and also to create a smiling face effect.<sup><a href="#02">[2]</a></sup> <sup><a
        href="#03">[3]</a></sup><br>
        Despite its success and growth in its range of products, size and market share, Amazon still made no profit.
        Bezos held fast though, and in 2001, after focusing on reducing operating costs, Amazon finally made a profit of
        $5 million.
        In the following years, Amazon continued to grow and acquire several brands such as Joyo.com, CreateSpace.com,
        BookSurge and Audible.com.
        Amazon Web Services was officially launched in 2006, and entailed several web services.
        Amazon Web Services has the largest market share of the Cloud Infrastructure Services market, with almost a
        third of market share.
        In the final quarter of 2007, the first Kindle model was also launched, which initially sold out within hours.
        Amazon continued to introduce new services, such as the Amazon cloud drive and cloud player.
        By the time 2011 came around, Amazon was selling more Kindle books than actual printed books.
        Currently, Amazon is one of the biggest online stores in the world and still sports a rapid growth.<sup><a
