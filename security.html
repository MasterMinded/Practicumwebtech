            <h1>Amazon's security</h1>
            <p>
                With the massive customer base Amazon has, all sending in valuable data (credit card numbers, address information etc) security becomes a very important topic. Amazon uses the Secure Socket Layer protocol to store the financial data of customers in a separate database. Aside from this Amazon also uses IPV6 which has been proven to be better than IPV4.

            </p>

            <h2>DDoS Mitigation and Port Sweep Prevention (Security)</h2>
            <p>
                Amazon of course takes security very seriously, which is why they have also incorporated software to mitigate DDoS attacks and prevent port sweeps. Ping sweeps and port scans will likely be the initial steps of the assault in light of the fact that they give the potential assailant a considerable measure about our system and in addition benefits, and open ports, on a PC framework or our system. Ping expansiveness would be the first mechanical assembly an aggressor would take when he concentrates on our association's PC structures. It is included a movement of ICMP resonation requests sent to an extent of IP areas to make sense of which IPs are being utilized by a host. A ping broadness is a gainful instrument that can outfit an aggressor with a framework aide of all contraptions on the framework, including has, switches, and other sorted out devices. With this information an attacker can set up an ambush course of action on framework servers and has or can be used just to hinder the framework.
                With the suitable firewall set up protecting the framework from pings outside of the LAN, then we can wipe out these sorts of ping extents. However a ping reach ought to be conceivable if the attacker has section to the LAN that is being centered around.The second instrument of a concentrated on ambush is a port sweeps. Once an attacker has masterminded an aide of a framework, strikes can begin on the distinctive servers and has within our framework. A port sweeps can teach the assailant with respect to the organizations and applications running on that server or host. It does this by separating a server or host for open ports and reports back which ports are opened. With this information an attacker can mastermind a specific sort of strike on a PC or server.
                A fair case would be if port 80 is open, then that host is our web server and serves up web development. A practical attack against it would be a DoS, in which a movement of HTTP sales surges the server and the framework with action, bringing on distinctive customers to be not capable use the web server.
