      <h1>Amazon's market dominance</h1>
      <p>
        Amazon is one of the biggest companies in the world, and will likely continue to dominate for years to come.
        Even though, in its early years, Amazon did not turn out a profit, it has been growing and expanding since its
        creation.
        Even though Amazon’s initial market was books, they have expanded well beyond that and offer almost anything you
        can think of (and easily ship off).
        Despite this expansion, one of their main selling points remains books, or in fact ebooks, to be precise.
        Amazon is the single largest supplier of ebooks, with about two thirds of all ebooks coming from Amazon, as is
        illustrated in the pie chart.
        <sup><a href="#04" class="anchor" id="4">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="#08" class="anchor" id="8">[8]</a></sup>
      <div id="piechart" class="pie"></div>
      <p>
        Their Kindle ebook reader is largely responsible for Amazon’s dominance in this product category.<br>
        Even though Amazon has not made any significant profit during its more than 20 years of existence, their revenue
        has grown exponentially, as you can see in the graph.
        Maybe you can actually say that they have expanded because of this lack of profit, because all the income was
        spent on expanding the business, with the acquisition of several big brands the focus of this increase in
        revenue.
        What you can also see in the graph is that Amazon’s growth had a big boost around 2008, which by and large
        coincides with the introduction of the Kindle ebook reader.
        Amazon’s business model depends on finding new products and services to supply that their customers want, and
        the Kindle is a good example of that, illustrated by the fact that it was was sold out within six hours of its
        initial release.
        A smaller boost can also be spotted in 2006, when Amazon Web Service was launched.
        <sup><a href="#02" class="anchor" id="2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#06" class="anchor"
                                                                      id="6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#07"
                                                                                                  class="anchor" id="7">[7]</a></sup>
      <div id="sales" class="graph"></div>
      <p>
        In the long term, Amazon’s business model has borne fruit. The next graph shows Amazon’s annual profit, as well
        as the total accumulated debt or profit, and by 2009, you can see that their profits had exceeded their losses.
      <div id="netincome" class="graph"></div>
      <p>
        While media, and obviously books in particular, were Amazon’s main focus, electronics and general merchandise
        have grown into their main source of revenue, while Amazon Web Services is also steadily returning more income.
        As this is a service rather than a product, and it is sold to different customers, the potential for growth
        seems to be a little different from Amazon’s webstore products.
        Nonetheless, Amazon Web Services is currently the largest player in the Cloud Infrastructure Services market,
        with a market share of 28% in 2014. At the same time, the Amazon.com website had a market share of 22% of online
        shopping visits, ahead of ebay.com, which came in at 17%, while 50% went to numerous smaller businesses. In
        fact, Amazon is far outperforming the other main internet retailers, who have annual sales figures of about $10
        billion at most, while Amazon sells for over $100 billion a year, and is still selling more each year.<br>
        I think we can safely say that Amazon.com Inc. is one of the most successful, innovative and fast-growing
        companies in the world.
