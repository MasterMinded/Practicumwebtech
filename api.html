            <h1>Amazon API and Methods</h1>
            <p>
                Amazon is the leading online global market place, where you can buy anything from a rubber boat to a box of soda, and with this leading mogul comes a plethora of user benefits such as Amazon’s very lucrative developer API system. The system goes by the name of Product Advertising API and it fundamentally allows you to retrieve and search products in mass quantity, and uses the same HMAC signature system as eBay. Along with this, Amazon offers administrations and APIs to offer you some assistance with enhancing your iOS applications. With Amazon Cloud Drive, Login with Amazon, Amazon Mobile Ads Network, and A/B Testing you can fabricate, win, and test drawing in applications encounters.  If you are using a PC or MAC, you can enjoy the leisure of being able to circulate your PC and Mac applications to new clients through two committed storefronts on Amazon.com - Digital Software and Games Store and Indie Games Stores. It's anything but difficult to begin. In order to access this system, one must have both a AWS developer key and a SHA-1 hash from a simple function compute. Amazon is helpful in aiding their users through the many API methods, as a full in-depth beginners guide is available on their website. They also give their users access to the full API documentation.
                Another common method Amazon members utilize in order to connect to Amazon’s developer API software is SOAP, through C#. Using normal API methods, you would usually have to encrypt the URL in a very precise way, but with the SOAP through C# methods users can bask in the glory of being able to do this much easier, as all they would have to do is encrypt the much shorter operation + timestamp. On amazon’s website, it specifically states, “The Amazon Appstore allows developers to distribute and sell their Android and HTML5 web apps to millions of customers in 236 countries and territories around the world through the Amazon device ecosystem and the Amazon Underground app. Our SDKs give developers access to a range of APIs and services to earn more revenue, engage audiences, and manage apps.” (Amazon). While it is great that Amazon goes to certain lengths in order to provide these services to their members, they do not do a great job at pushing or advertising such services of API development.
                It often proves strenuous just to find the developer API documentation. In this sense, Amazon failed in provided an easier-to-use system, as it cannot be compared to the feasibility and ease of use that eBay’s developer API system provides.   Overall, Amazon’s API is intricate enough to provide developers with whatever tools they’d need, whether it is app development or something else in that nature. Amazon allows its user to not only join in on the development of the mogul community, but to use the system from a number of perspectives which can benefit almost any developer.
