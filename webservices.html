            <h1>Amazon Web Services</h1>
                <p>
                The Amazon Web Services (a collection of services), contains a lot of services regarding to cloud computing. These services can be further categorized into: Compute (such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud), networking, storage and content delivery, database, deployment, management, application services and analytics. The servers providing these services are located all over the world, as displayed in the image below.

            <h2>Amazon CloudFront</h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon has it’s own content delivery network (CDN) called Amazon CloudFront. A CDN is a network of proxy servers (located all over the world) which cache content.The purpose of a CDN is to make (web)content quickly accessible for users. The content can vary from text, documents, figures, media, media streams, scripts and applications.  In figure 2 the difference between a single server (left image) and a CDN (right image) can be seen.

            <h2>Amazon elastic compute cloud (compute)</h2>
                <p>
                    A service provided by amazon which allows users to hire virtual machines, which the customer can then use to run their own applications. A customer can boot a so called “Amazon Machine Image” through a web service to configure this virtual machine. This virtual machine can be created and terminated at any time and payment is required for each hour such a virtual machine is active. EC2 (elastic compute cloud) uses software called “Xen” to create and to run the virtual machines. This “Xen”software allows Amazon to run multiple operating systems on the same computer.

                    Amazon has reached the surface of supercomputers through such innovations; however, like many others they still have limits.  which brings up our next topic: intractability. Computers are faster than ever today yet they still have many limitations. There are things that they can do and things they cannot do. A major problem today is that even though a computer can solve certain problems, meaning it has the capability to do so, it will not be able to do so in an efficient amount of time, and Amazon is trying to solve this. This is one of the many aspects in computer science which researchers have been trying to solve for decades. It all revolves around the concepts of complexity and tractability. A problem can be solved with a computer because we know what to tell the computer to do, but it isn’t able to be solved due to the limitations a computer has, based of calculation speed and complexity. Programmers know how to solve problems, just they don’t have the means to implement their solutions, and this is all due to algorithms taking too long to solve a problem, or not being as efficient as they need to be. This concept of how much time it takes for a computer to solve a problem or how many steps it will take to find the answer, is defined as complexity. The more complex a problem, the more work a computer has to do to find the solution, it could be that it takes longer or it takes too many steps to solve the problem. A problem is defined to be tractable or intractable, referring the ability of a problem to be solved using current algorithms in a reasonable amount of time. Tractable problems are problems where there are lots of algorithms, which are efficient and inefficient in getting the job done, but they work. On the other hand, intractable problems are ones where the only known algorithm to solve that problem is one that takes an exorbitant amount of time. These concepts are important to computer science because a programmer should be able to determine whether or not they can develop a tractable solution for the simplest of problems, meaning that they might be able to create a solution for the problem but it isn’t efficient enough to be able to be executed or implemented.  Now the effectiveness of these solutions is the best they can be right now since computational power is limiting. Solutions such as the greedy heuristic and permutation sort are the best they can be right now with our current knowledge. Some aren’t as efficient as they could be because we don’t know of a better way to solve those problems. A solution is only as effective as the speed at which it can go with a limited amount of computational power. Another problem is the Towers of Hanoi problem, where you have to stack disks of different sizes in increasing order on one and two pegs. Some solution would take longer to calculate than the amount of time left in the universe, showing the need for research and advancements in the way we compute the solution, not necessarily the means of their implementation.
